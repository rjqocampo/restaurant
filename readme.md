### Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Other tools used:
  
  * Webpack for module bundler
  * NPM for package manager
  * Github Pages for free hosting
  * Git for version control
  * Figma for mockup
  * Chrome DevTools for debugging

### Motivation
* To practice and refine Javascript and CSS fundamentals 
* To get comfortable using package managers and module bundlers
* To implement and learn mobile responsiveness

### My Learnings
* Value of Chrome DevTools for checking layout
* Value of SASS variables and nesting for cleaner CSS
* Importance of media queries for responsiveness
* Importance of CSS functions(i.e. clamp and calc) for dynamic sizing
* Importance of DRY methodology
* Usefulness of modules to structure code and reduce code size for better maintainability
* Usefulness of NPM to track and manage project dependencies
* Usefulness of Webpack in bundling code for smoother UX

### Known Issues
* Slow load of images
* Reservation feature does not store data
